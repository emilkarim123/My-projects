# My-projects
These are the projects that I've worked on, some are finished and some are still a work in progress. This respository consists mostly of school projects that I've done during
two years of studying. As you can see I've worked quite a bit in elixir, creating some simple projects to get familiar with elixir and functional programming. This was a great 
learning experience. My proudest projects HTTPAsk and ConcHTTPAsk where I created a server- and client socket that I made for for my networking course. This was made with java.
